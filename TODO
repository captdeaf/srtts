TODO for SR TTS:
----------------

Assets (Trin):
  Frontiers: Images from Trin.
  Slick and shiny new images for all cards from SR official
  Table background and player area images?

SR Cards (VV):
  Frontiers: card definitions
  Double Ally addition
  scrap->discard at endofturn

Code for TTS handling:
  allies: track guids, and special cases for heroes.
  UI for trade row and moused-over card - screw ALT zoom!
  scrap "pile" - a card can be scrapped and regenerates in discard pile at end of turn.
