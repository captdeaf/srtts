BUGS:
-----
** Cards sometimes vanish when player is almost out of cards.
   e.g: <= 5 cards total in discard+deck, one will vanish?
   (triggers die of sanity check).
doAttackEnemyCard: bugs if you "attack" a card in enemy hand.
Clicking "Play Star Realms" while unable to start gets a broken menu
2headed hydra doesn't start (AI confused?)
unscripted editing of authority doesn't work.

TODO for SR TTS:
----------------

Assets (Trin):
  Frontiers: Images from Trin, up-side-right for bases (instead of left)
  Slick and shiny new images for all cards from SR official
  Table background and player area images?

Card effects:
  allies: track+count unique guids, and special cases for heroes. (to enable counting
          for combo allies)

QOL:
  UI for trade row and moused-over card - screw ALT zoom!

Frontiers:
  combo ally effect
    (Requires ally cleanup for guid tracking, hero special case)
  uniq: recoverme: Mobile Market returns to discard pile at end of turn if scrapped.
    (2 stages: onturnend={uniq={"giftcard", "mobilemarket"}}

Bosses:
  Assets
  Rules implementation (built on top of house rules)
  Scenario selection

DONE:
  uniq: reclamationstation - 3 damage per scrapped card.
  tradescrap => cardUse
  discardtotop check type
  mayscrap, mustscrap => carduse
  discardfor => cardUse
  recycle => cardUse

  Frontiers:
    uniq: scrapcycle for cost damage (scrap trade card for 1 damage per cost, or from hand or discard)
    card definitions

  BUGS:
    return base / doReturnCards: setting play state for a returned card fails.
    Undescribed effect for star fortress, embassy base, machine base: 1

  QOL:
    Clear the Turn UI immediately on end turn, rather than waiting 'til after draw, etc.
